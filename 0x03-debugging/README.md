## THIS DIRECTORY HOUSES ALL THE SOLUTIONS FOR THE TASKS ON 0x03. C-DEBUGGING

The file 0-main.c is a C program that test the function positive_or_negative(int i) for the case of zero (0).

The file 1-main.c is a C program with an infinite loop that has to be correct by commenting out the part of the file that causes the infinite loop.

The file 2-largest_number.c is a function to identify the largest of three integers. This function had an error which I corrected.

The file 3-print_remaining_days() is a C function that prints the remaining days of the year, whether leap or not. It had an error in deciding which year is leap or not and I fixed it as my task.
