## This describes the purpose of these functions and programs.

The file 0-isupper.c is a C function that checks for uppercase character.

Prototype: int \_isupper(int c);
Returns 1 if c is uppercase
Returns 0 otherwise

The file 1-isdigit is a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).

Prototype: int _isdigit(int c);
Returns 1 if c is a digit
Returns 0 otherwise

The file 2-mul.c is a C function that multiplies two integers
Prototype: int mul(int a, int b);

The file 3-print_numbers.c is a C function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void print_numbers(void);
You can only use _putchar twice in your code

The file 4-print_most_numbers.c is a C function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void print_most_numbers(void);
Do not print 2 and 4
You can only use _putchar twice in your code

The file 5-more_numbers.c is a C function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void more_numbers(void);
You can only use _putchar three times in your code

The file 6-print_line.c is a C function that draws a straight line in the terminal.

Prototype: void print_line(int n);
You can only use _putchar function to print
Where n is the number of times the character _ should be printed
The line should end with a \n
If n is 0 or less, the function should only print \n

The file 7-print_diagonal.c is a C function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.

Prototype: void print_diagonal(int n);
You can only use _putchar function to print
Where n is the number of times the character \ should be printed
The diagonal should end with a \n
If n is 0 or less, the function should only print a \n

The file 8-print_squre is a C function that prints a square, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void print_square(int size);
You can only use _putchar function to print
Where size is the size of the square
If size is 0 or less, the function should print only a new line
Use the character # to print the square

The file 9-fizz_buzz.c is a C program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.

Each number or word should be separated by a space
You are allowed to use the standard library

The file 10-print_triangle.c is a c function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void print_triangle(int size);
You can only use _putchar function to print
Where size is the size of the triangle
If size is 0 or less, the function should print only a new line
Use the character # to print the triangle

The file 100-prime_factor.c is a C program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line.

You are allowed to use the standard library
Your program will be compiled with this command: gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 100-prime_factor.c -o 100-prime_factor -lm

The file 101-print_number.c is a C function that prints an integer.

Prototype: void print_number(int n);
You can only use _putchar function to print
You are not allowed to use long
You are not allowed to use arrays or pointers
You are not allowed to hard-code special values
