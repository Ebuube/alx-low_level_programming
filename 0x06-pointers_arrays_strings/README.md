## DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES PERTAINING TO PARTICULAR TASKS

The file 0-strcat.c is a C function that concatenates two strings.

Prototype: char *_strcat(char *dest, char *src);
This function appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte
Returns a pointer to the resulting string dest

The file 1-strncat.c is a C function that concatenates two strings.

Prototype: char *_strncat(char *dest, char *src, int n);
The _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that
it will use at most n bytes from src; and
src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes
Return a pointer to the resulting string dest

The file 2-strncpy.c is a C function  that copies a string.

Prototype: char *_strncpy(char *dest, char *src, int n);
Your function should work exactly like strncpy

The file 3-strcmp.c is a C function that compares two strings.

Prototype: int _strcmp(char *s1, char *s2);
Your function should work exactly like strcmp

The file 4-rev_array.c is a C function that reverses the content of an array of integers.

Prototype: void reverse_array(int *a, int n);
Where n is the number of elements of the array

The file 5-string_toupper.c is a C function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.

Prototype: char *string_toupper(char *);

The file 6-cap_string.c is a C function that capitalizes all words of a string.

Prototype: char *cap_string(char *);
Separators of words: space, tabulation, new line, ,, ;, ., !, ?, ", (, ), {, and }

The file 7-leet.c is a C function that encodes a string into 1337.

Letters a and A should be replaced by 4
Letters e and E should be replaced by 3
Letters o and O should be replaced by 0
Letters t and T should be replaced by 7
Letters l and L should be replaced by 1
Prototype: char *leet(char *);

Prototype: void print_number(int n);
You can only use _putchar function to print
You are not allowed to use long
You are not allowed to use arrays or pointers
You are not allowed to hard-code special values

The file 102-magic.c is a C program and is modified so that the program prints a[2] = 98, followed by a new line.

You are not allowed to use the variable a in your new line of code
You are not allowed to modify the variable p
