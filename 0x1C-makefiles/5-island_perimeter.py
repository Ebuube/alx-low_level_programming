- `grid` is a list of list of integers:
    *   0 represents a water zone
    *   1 represents a land zone
    *   One cell is a square with side length 1
    *   Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).
    *   Grid is rectangular, width and height don’t exceed 100

- Grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is one island (or nothing).
- The island doesn’t have “lakes” (water inside that isn’t connected
    to the water around the island)
