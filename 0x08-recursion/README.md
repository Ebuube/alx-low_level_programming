The function 0-puts_recursion.c is a C function that prints a string, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void _puts_recursion(char *s);

The file 1-print_rev_recursion.c is a C function that prints a string in reverse.

Prototype: void _print_rev_recursion(char *s);

The file 2-strlen_recursion.c is a C function that returns the length of a string.

Prototype: int _strlen_recursion(char *s);

The file 3-factorial.c is a C function that returns the factorial of a given number.

Prototype: int factorial(int n);
If n is lower than 0, the function should return -1 to indicate an error
Factorial of 0 is 1

The file 4-pow_recursion.c is a C function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.

Prototype: int _pow_recursion(int x, int y);
If y is lower than 0, the function should return -1

The file 5-sqrt_recursin.c is a C function that returns the natural square root of a number.

Prototype: int _sqrt_recursion(int n);
If n does not have a natural square root, the function should return -1

The file 6-is_prime_number.c is a C function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.

Prototype: int is_prime_number(int n);

The file 100-check_palindrome is a C function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not.

Prototype: int is_palindrome(char *s);
An empty string is a palindrome
